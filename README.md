Project Description:

The Pay Slip Generation System (PSG) is a menu-driven application developed in C++ that automates the generation of salary slips for employees. It captures employee data such as name, ID, department, designation, salary, income tax, and overtime hours. Based on these inputs, it computes various salary components including DA, HRA, PF, and generates a formatted pay slip for each employee.

Key Features of the PSG:

Add new employees dynamically.

Store and manage multiple employee records.

Generate individual pay slips by employee ID.

Calculate gross and net salary based on:

DA (50% of basic)

HRA (20% of basic)

PF (12% deduction for permanent employees)

Income Tax and Professional Tax (fixed)

Medical allowance and Overtime dues


View all employee summaries.
